        <p>I think Ios is the better one, because it is easier to use and no worry about any about system lag
        In addition, IOS more care about the users privacy, you have option to stop app to tracking your data</p>

        <p> I think android is better than ios because it provides more flexibility and is lot more cheaper than ios. It gives 
            us much more control over the phone as you can customize android and make it look familiar and make it feel your own and customize
            with your own style
